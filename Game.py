# Your bot should be a class, which contains a function called make_move(self, board). It should return a move which a bot would make for a given state of board - board.
# It should return a list of Positions, representing the piece's move. Its first element should be a piece's starting Position and the next values should encode the piece's path:

# For a single move (one step or one capture), return a two-element array of Positions: the starting position of a piece which you want to move and its position adfter the move.
# For instane, if you have a pawn at (2, 0) and want to move it to (3, 1), return: [Position(2, 0), Position(3, 1)]
# If you have a piece at (4, 4) and want to move to (6, 6), capturing an opponent's piece at (5, 5), return: [Position(4, 4), Position(6, 6)]
# If you have a king at (0, 4) and want to move to (4, 0), capturing an opponent's piece at (3, 1), return: [Position(0, 4), Position(4, 0)]

# For complex moves (capturing more than one piece), the array should be longer.
# The first position should represent the starting position of the piece you want to move and the last element - the position where you want to finish your move.
# All the intermediate positions should represent 'checking points' during your moves, i. e. where you land just after capturing a piece.
# For instance, if you have a king standing at (0, 0) and want to capture an enemy's piece from (3, 3), then from (6, 6), then turn and capture one from (7, 5) and then slide and finish your move on (9, 3), you should pass as a move the following array:
# [Position(0, 0), Position(4, 4), Position(7, 7), Position(9, 3)]
